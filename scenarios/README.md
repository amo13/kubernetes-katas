#### Overview
Applications might face issues when trying to mount persistent volumes, which can be due to misconfigurations or underlying storage issues.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Create a persistent volume with incorrect access modes.
  2. Create a persistent volume claim that references the volume.
  3. Create a pod that mounts the persistent volume claim.
  4. Apply all configurations and observe the pod failing to start.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Update the persistent volume to have the correct access modes.
  2. Apply the updated configuration: `kubectl apply -f persistent-volume.yaml`.
  3. Delete and recreate the pod to attempt mounting the volume again.

### 4. Resource Limitations

#### Overview
Setting appropriate resource requests and limits is crucial to ensure that your applications have the resources they need to run effectively.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Create a pod with very low resource limits.
  2. Apply the configuration: `kubectl apply -f pod-definition.yaml`.
  3. Observe that the pod might be evicted or fail to run effectively.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Update the pod definition to have more reasonable resource limits.
  2. Apply the updated configuration: `kubectl apply -f pod-definition.yaml`.
  3. Observe that the pod is now running effectively.

### 5. Security and RBAC Issues

#### Overview
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes helps in defining what actions users or applications can perform. Misconfigurations can lead to access issues.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Create a Role and RoleBinding (or ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding) with very limited permissions.
  2. Try to perform an action that requires more permissions and observe the failure.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Update the Role (or ClusterRole) to include the necessary permissions.
  2. Apply the updated configuration: `kubectl apply -f role-definition.yaml`.
  3. Retest the action and observe that it now succeeds.

### 6. ConfigMap and Secret Issues

#### Overview
Applications might fail if they cannot access the necessary configuration data or secrets.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Create a ConfigMap or Secret with incorrect data.
  2. Mount the ConfigMap or Secret in a pod.
  3. Apply all configurations and observe the application failing.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Update the ConfigMap or Secret with the correct data.
  2. Apply the updated configuration: `kubectl apply -f configmap-or-secret.yaml`.
  3. Delete and recreate the pod to mount the updated ConfigMap or Secret.

### 7. Upgrade Issues

#### Overview
Upgrading Kubernetes or applications can sometimes lead to issues if not done carefully.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster or application without checking compatibility.
  2. Observe any issues that arise post-upgrade.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Roll back to the previous version if necessary.
  2. Check compatibility and perform any required pre-upgrade steps.
  3. Retry the upgrade.

### 8. High Availability and Failover

#### Overview
Ensuring high availability and seamless failover is crucial for production applications.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Set up an application with a single replica.
  2. Simulate a node failure or delete the pod and observe downtime.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Update the deployment to use multiple replicas spread across different nodes.
  2. Apply the updated configuration: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.
  3. Retest node failure or pod deletion and observe reduced downtime.

### 9. Monitoring and Logging

#### Overview
Proper monitoring and logging are essential for troubleshooting and maintaining the health of your applications.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Set up an application without any monitoring or logging solutions in place.
  2. Try to troubleshoot an issue without sufficient logs or metrics.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Set up and configure a monitoring and logging solution such as Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
  2. Ensure logs and metrics are being collected.
  3. Retest troubleshooting with the available logs and metrics.

### 10. Resource Leaks and Orphaned Resources

#### Overview
Over time, Kubernetes clusters might accumulate unused or orphaned resources, leading to resource wastage.

#### Tasks
- **Creating the Problem**:
  1. Create and delete numerous resources without cleaning up associated resources.
  2. Observe the accumulation of orphaned resources.

- **Fixing the Problem**:
  1. Identify and manually delete orphaned resources.
  2. Use tools like `kubectl-prune` to automate the cleanup of unused resources.
